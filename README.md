# COVID Dashboard

## Overview
In this project I wanted to look into the data on COVID in order to create a basic dashboard that will help others easily understand and view the analysis and insights.

## Technologies used
To query the data from 'Our World In Data' I used SQL. I wrote scripts that cleaned and summarised the data and then saved these tables as excel files. Following this I used Tableau to create my dashboard by importing the excel tables and finding the best visualisations to fit the insights.

## Data Source
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## Dashboard
You can find the dashboard in Tableau Public here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gurpal.gohler/viz/COVIDDashboard_16836402930780/Dashboard1
